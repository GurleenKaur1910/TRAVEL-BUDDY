# Travel-Buddy

Objective: The Travel Buddy software project seeks to cater to the travel needs of college
students by offering a platform that helps them find reliable travel companions for journeys to
their home destinations. The primary focus is on providing companionship, ensuring security,
and reducing travel expenses, particularly for individuals who are new to a city or university
and lack acquaintances from the same hometown

Project Overview:

Background:
College students, especially those in unfamiliar surroundings, often face the challenge of
finding travel companions for journeys to their home locations. Travel Buddy is designed to
address this issue by creating a platform that connects individuals with similar travel plans,
fostering a sense of companionship, enhancing security, and reducing the financial burden
associated with solo travel.

Features:
User Profiles: Users are encouraged to create comprehensive profiles containing information
such as name, hometown, travel destination, and preferences. This allows for better matching
based on common interests and travel routes.
Matching Algorithm: The application incorporates an intelligent matching algorithm that
analyzes user profiles and travel plans to connect individuals with compatible travel
companions.
Secure Messaging: Travel Buddy provides a secure messaging system to facilitate
communication between users. This feature enables travelers to plan their journey and get to
know each other before embarking on the trip.
Reviews and Ratings: Users have the ability to rate and review their travel companions. This
feature contributes to a trustworthy community, helping future users make informed decisions
when selecting travel buddies.
Expense Sharing: The platform encourages users to coordinate and share travel expenses,
promoting a cost-effective approach to traveling.
Safety Measures: To ensure a secure travel experience, the platform incorporates safety features
such as real-time location sharing and emergency contacts.
